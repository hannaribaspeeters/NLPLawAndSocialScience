# NLPLawAndSocialScience

This repository contains my completed assignments for the Spring 2023 ETH Course, "Natural Language Processing for Law and Social Science", instructed by Prof. Elliott Ash (elliottash.com).
In this course we explored the use of NLP for social science research, not just in the law but also in politics, the economy, and culture. We explored, critiqued, and integrated the emerging set of tools for debiasing language models and think carefully about how notions of fairness should be applied in this domain.
